It's been more than a year that I took up Full Stacks development. And thoughout this process I have have continiously honed my skills and worked on multiple skilled based projects. This has been quite a journey for me and along the way I have realized that this was something which I was searching for, something that fascinates me and tickle my intelletual instinct. Apart from a student developer, I am a musician and crazy about music. I run my own channel on YouTube and Instagram by the name of Leftover_Algorhythms and am the lead singer there. This has been a journey for trying to up my skills in every aspect and be an inspiration for the generations to follow.",
